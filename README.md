This is my first modularized ML project

#This tells Git to ignore all virtual environment and cache files in the future.
#You’re on Windows, and Git is telling you that some files (inside your virtual environment, venv/) use Unix #line endings (LF), but Git (or your local Git config) converts them to Windows-style line endings (CRLF).
#is just saying: “I’ll change line endings when I write this file later.”
